                <p> Focus on consistency rather than perfection. It's better to do a little bit every day than to try to do too much at once and burn out.</p>

                <p> Make sure to hydrate and practice good sleep hygiene to support your fitness goals.</p>
                <p> Focus on technique instead on going heavy, practice makes perfect.</p>
                <P> Don't be scared to look at guides to see if your preformance is on par.</P>
                <P> Fuel yourelf before lifting any weight, going on low food fuel is a recipe for disaster.
